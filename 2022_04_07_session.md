## Videogame Development Pt. 7
- Creating a puzzle
- Reaching an objective
- Displaying game information

### Creating a puzzle
- We're nearing a playable game
  - With the components we have, we can start arranging a level
- Try different arrangements of slime, moveable obstacles, obstacles, and player positions
- Try changing the shape of the 'TileMap'
- Some mechanical ideas
  - Remember creating the 'Position2D' nodes for resetting after slime is touched?
  - These could be moved or reset when the player makes certain moves
    - could _not_ reset moveable obstacle positions
    - could change player starting position after moving certain boxes

### Review our objective
- we have to stick to what is not slime
- but we also have to escape a maze
  - by moving blocks that are not slime

### Reaching the end of the maze
- we need to make an end-game position
- this can be placeable within the level
  - ideally, poses a challenge for the player to reach
- reaching this point should reset the level
- it should indicate that the level is completed

#### Implementing the maze objective

#### Scripting the maze objective

### Displaying information to the player
- the player can now complete the game
- we can now add some kind of indication that the game is over
  - and an indication that the game has started
  - separate from the typical reset on death
  
#### Implementing the splash screen (title + game end)

### What other additions can you imagine?
- lives count
- multiple objectives
- load another level on completion
- timer for completing the level

### Next time
- bring in your level designs, new mechanics, game functions, other creations
