## Videogame programming Pt. 2
- how to use the Godot editor
- engine + editor concepts
- creating a new project
- adding a scene
- creating a sprite

### Beginning game development
- related to last weeks question - constraining your objective
  - understanding what's feasible (for you)
  - documenting your accomplishments
- graphic ambitions, gameplay ambitions, physics ambitions, sound ambitions, control, etc
  - balancing these constraints to create a game within your plan
- programming is a skill you will need to make your game
  - but it's approachable and has _broad_ utility
  - Really thorough, free online [introductory course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- this series doesn't assume any programming background (other than you knowing what it is)
  - I'll demonstrate scripting so you can see how programming becomes a part of development

### Required tools
- The Godot engine + editor, download [here](https://godotengine.org/download)
- Something to edit code or plain text with
  - I recommend Sublime Text, Notedpad++, Atom, or Visual Studio Code

### Starting the [Godot engine + editor](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html)
- Godot provides good documentation for getting setup and creating a project
- A 3D workspace is open by default
  - this series will produce a 2D game, switch to 2D with the center top control
- Once inside the editor
  - Scene and File menus to the left
  - Node / scene 'Inspector' on the right
  - Select Workspaces from the ribbon at the center > top
  - Playtest controls at the top right
  - Viewport in the middle, tools at the top left
- You can create a 2D 'scene'
  - scenes make up the base ideas in your game
  - create a scene and save - this will save our project so far
- Find 'Help' at the top left ribbon

## Concepts

### Basic concepts within Godot
- Think of your game as a tree .. of trees ..

### Godot is considered '[object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)'
- [Composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition)
  - Things (objects, nodes) are composed of others
  - objects have child objects, which might have child objects... 'tree branches'
- Godot lets you aggregate objects to form others
- You can reuse the objects all over
  - but edit the 'basis' of that type of object, and you update all of them

### Building blocks (objects)
- how Godot deals with organization

#### scenes
- Appear on the left-hand side of the editor
  - Godot uses nesting to represent the tree
- consist of 'nodes', associated scripts ... and other scenes!
- Not quite like in a movie (but can be)
- Groups of resources that are closely related
  - A 'house' scene might have windows, doors, furniture, etc.
  - 'house' might have a 'television' scene, which has a screen, antennae, etc.
- The topmost level (the outermost part) of your game consists of scenes

#### nodes
- tiniest part of the game
- also can be made up of other nodes!
- nodes + scenes are somewhat interchangeable but have some different properties
  - scenes are more like collections of basic parts
  - nodes are meant to be thought of as those basic parts

#### signals
- game events, which come from nodes
- you can reference them in scripts, or connect them to other nodes
- there are built in signals, and you can also make your own
  - 'player hits object', 'menu option selected'

## A space castaway
- alone, we are stranded on a plane made of blood / goo / slime
  - not everything is slime... but most things are
  - we realize that if we touch anything made of slime, we turn into to slime - terrible
- we have to stick to what is not slime
- but we also have to escape a maze
  - by moving blocks that are not slime

### Getting the project started
- change the display resolution to a square
  - go to 'Project Settings' and click 'Search', enter 'window'
  - Under the 'Display' section, select the 'Window' category
  - set Stretch mode and aspect to '2d' and 'keep'
    - this way, the ratio doesn't change for different displays
  - notice the update in the viewport
- Save things again

### Making the space character
- Adding a meaningful scene
  - make sure you create a net new scene - not a child node
    - notice a new editor tab opens
  - rather than 2D scene, pick 'Other Node' and select an 'Area2D' type of node
  - This will let our character collide
- Using composition, we can get more function from a simple node
  - before we do this - make sure we don't accidentally select child nodes (which we'll be adding)
    - the icon next to the lock at the top

### Add frames for the animation
- frames or images make up an animation
  - the frames are sequenced to emulate movement
- add frames for each one using the 'Animation Frames' tools
  - might not be perfect but, can touch up later
- Save

#### Add an 'AnimatedSprite' node (_Graphics_)
- once you've added the node, use the 'Inspector' on the right to view the properties
  - this is everything we'd want to know about the node
- Find the 'Frames' property, select 'New SpriteFrames'
- you should see an 'Animations' dock appear
- Add a 'walk' and 'idle' animation (on the left-hand side)
- find some pngs (or make them) and add them to your project folder
  - they'll show up in the FileSystem tab on the lefthand side
- Associate a '.png' file with each animation
  - PNG files are typically used for frames
  - I found mine at itch.io from artist [Pixfinity](https://pixfinity.itch.io/scificharacter3)
    - if ever you use art, attribute the source and follow any instructions indicated by the artist! Same goes for any asset

### Press the play button at the top right
- you should now see a preview with your sprite
  - I noticed my sprite was small relative to the playfield
  - I changed this by modifying the Castway property 'Transform' under 'Node2D' in the inspector
    - Set x, y 'Scale' to 2
- Press the play button again to preview

### Next time
- Moving the player
- Animating motion
- Colliding with the world
