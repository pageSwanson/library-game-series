## Videogame Development Pt. 6
- Movable obstacles (boxes)
- Creating a puzzle

### Layers and masks
- Godot provides a collision layer system for managing how objects see one another
  - used to help interpret whether a collision has occurred, and who was collided
  - Layers are used to differentiate scenes as unique colliders
  - Masks are used to determine which layers to interact with
- Now that we have multiple types of obstacles, the _Castaway_, and the level boundaries
- We can name and assign layers for these different classes of objects
  - Go to 'Project > Project Settings...' 
  - Find 'Layer Names > 2d Physics'
  - assign layer names for 1 _Castaway_, 2 _Obstacle_, 3 _SlimeObstacle_, 4 _MovableObstacle_
- Once the layers are in place, we need to mask each of the scenes for the collisions we expect
  - _Castaway_ collides with all layers
  - _Obstacle_ scenes and the 'TileMap' collide with the _Castaway_ and _MovableObstacle_
  - _SlimeObstacle_ collides with the _Castaway_ and the _MovableObstacle_
  - _MovableObstacle_ collides with all layers

### Reminded of our objective
- alone, we are stranded on a planet made of slime
  - not everything is slime... but most things are
  - we realize that if we touch anything made of slime, disappear - terrible
- we have to stick to what is not slime
- but we also have to escape a maze
  - by moving blocks that are not slime

### Movable obstacles (boxes)
- This obstacle is again similar to our _Obstacle_ and _SlimeObstacle_
  - so we'll reuse the base _Obstacle_ again by inheriting it
- We also want a few different behaviors
  - unlike the slime, when colliding with this object we want the _Castaway_ to push it
  - it should also collide with other obstacles

#### Implementing the inherited scene
- Similarly to the _SlimeObstacle_, we'll create a 'New Inherited Scene...' using the top ribbon
  - inherit from _Obstacle_
  - rename the scene 'MovableObstacle'
- In the 'Inspector' tab on the right-hand side
  - open the 'Collision' property and set the 'Layer' property to 'MovableObstacle'
  - set the 'Mask' property by enabling all layers 1-4
- Add a child instance of _MovableObstacle_ to the _Planet\_0_
  - should be a sibling of the other scenes
- Add a script for this scene
  - where we'll define behavior that differentiates it from the base _Obstacle_
- Save the new scene

#### Scripting the behavior of the moving box
- Open the newly created _MovableObstacle_ script and add a `push` function
  - what happens when the character pushes the box
- Add the function anywhere you like, above or below the `_ready` function
```
func push(velocity : Vector2) -> void:
	move_and_slide(velocity)
```
- Similiar to our implementation of the _Castaway_ movement
  - using `move_and_slide` means our obstacle will acknowledge collisions during motion
  - but, we still need to call this new function from somewhere

##### colliding with _MovableObstacle_
- Review the _Castaway_ script and recall the `_physics_process` function
  - we're going to check for this particular collison from our _Castaway_
  - like we did for the _SlimeObstacle_
- first, isolate the collider (what the _Castaway_ collided with) as a variable
  - we'll need to use it to push the obstacle from the _Castaway_ script
```
func _physics_process(delta : float) -> void:
	...
	move_and_slide(velocity * speed)
	for i in get_slide_count():
		# get the collider as a separate variable, use it on the next line to get the layer
		var collided_with : = get_slide_collision(i).collider
		var collision_layer : int = collided_with.get_collision_layer()
		...
```
- referencing the collision layer for _MovableObstacle_
  - check to see if we've collided
  - do so after we check for slime collisions - avoid allowing illegal movement
```
...
if collision_layer == 0b100:
	hide()
	$CollisionShape2D.set_deferred("disabled", true)
	emit_signal("hit")

# check the bit in the 4th position
if collision_layer == 0b1000:
    ...
```
##### pushing the _MovableObstacle_
- to push the box, we need to reference the obstacle we collided with
  - this should be the _MovableObstacle_ - we can do a [cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion) to ensure this
```
...
if collision_layer == 0b1000:
	# using half-speed for the player movement while pushing
	# simulating a heavy box
	collided_with.push(velocity * (speed / 2))
```
- If you've configured all your layers correctly, we should be calling the new `push` function
  - otherwise, you'll see an error in the Debugger output
- Save the script and test the scene

##### resetting the _MovableObstacle_
- as we do when the _Castaway_ hits the slime
- since this scene is also a child instance of _Planet\_0_
- create a new function on the _MovableObstacle_ script
```
func set_position(input_position : Vector2) -> void:
	position = input_position
```
- next, within the _Planet\_0_ scene, create a new 'Position2D' node
  - should be a child of _Planet\_0_
  - this will be used to initialize the _MovableObstacle_ position
  - within the 2D view editor, align the new position node with the expected location of the _MovableObstacle_
-  call the new function from within the _Planet\_0_ script
```
func initialize() -> void:
	$Castaway.initialize($StartPosition.position)
	$MovableObstacle.set_position($MovableObstaclePosition.position)
```
- Save, and test the level with the change
  - see that the moveable obstacle resets position when the player resets

#### Making a separate animation
- Open up the base _Obstacle_ so we can add a new animation for the _MovableObstacle_ to render
- For the 'AnimatedSprite' node, add another animation, called 'moving'
  - select and drag a texture you want to use that differs from the slime or the standard obstacle
- Keep in mind: the _MovableObstacle_ inherits from _Obstacle_
  - all animations will appear on the _MovableObstacle_
  - but we can select which one we want rendered in the scene
- Like we did for the _SlimeObstacle_
  - in the Inspector on the right, set the 'Animation' property to 'moving'
- Play the _Planet\_0_ level, and you should see that the instances appear differently now

### Creating a puzzle
- We're nearing a playable game
  - With the components we have, we can start arranging a level
- Try different arrangements of slime, moveable obstacles, obstacles, and player positions
- Try changing the shape of the 'TileMap'
- Some mechanical ideas
  - Remember creating the 'Position2D' nodes for resetting after slime is touched?
  - These could be moved or reset when the player makes certain moves
    - could _not_ reset moveable obstacle positions
    - could change player starting position after moving certain boxes

### Next time
- Reaching an objective
- Displaying game information
