## Videogame programming Pt. 3
- Moving the character (Castaway)
- Animating motion

#### Add a 'CollisionShape2D' node (_Physics_)
- Back in the inspector, choose the shape property
  - pick one that best matches the edges of your sprite (i.e. capsule)
  - fit it to your sprite in the viewport
- Save

#### Define player control of the Castaway
- we can code behavior in a script that responds to our controls
- From the top ribbon, select 'Project > Project Settings'
  - select the 'Input Map' tab at the top
- Add mappings for player inputs we'll want to handle
  - Input a name, then press 'Add'
  - moving left, right, up, and down
  - we'll reference these in script, so use names like `move_left`, etc.
  - click the '+' icon for each mapping
	- select the 'Key' input option
	- press the corresponding key on your keyboard for that control

### Scripting motion
- Start a script by right-clicking the 'Castaway' node, and selecting 'Attach Script'
  - Ensure 'GDScript' is chosen, and the filename 'Castaway.gd' is used before creating
  - you should see a script with a few lines of code, primarily comments
    - comment lines start with \#, and don't run with the rest of your code
  - the top right of this view has quick documentation / help links
  - note that this script `extends Area2D`
	- we'll have access to properties of this node in our script

#### Variables
- We can leave the template code and begin adding our own
- The following lines are variables (`var`)
  - data points that we can modify and use to create behavior
  - the `export` keyword before `speed` lets us adjust this property value in the Inspector

```
# Declare member variables here.
export var speed = 200 # How fast the player will move (pixels/sec).
var game_window_size 
```
- we'll stick to the convention of variable naming like `lower_case_underscores`
- save, and you'll see the script in the 'FileSystem' view on the left
  - Now clicking the Castaway node, you'll see the 'Speed' variable we created in the Inspector

#### On `_ready`
- you can revisit the script view by selecting the 'Script' workspace at the top
- the `_ready` function (`func`) is a special function that we can modify, which runs when the scene loads
- a good place to set the `game_window_size` variable

```
func _ready():
	game_window_size = get_viewport_rect().size # get_viewport_rect is a function provided by Godot
```
- the indentation before the variable is important here
  - it indicates that this piece of code is part of the `_ready` function, and should be executed when that function is used
- you can 'Cmd+click' or 'Ctrl+click' to quickly view the documentation for Godot keywords

#### On `_process`, or for every frame
- game engines model change over time in 'frames'
  - the engine builds a frame, displays it, processes changes and inputs, builds another with updates, displays it, etc.
- the `_process` function lets us dictate updates for each frame which are specific to the Castaway node scene
  - respond to controls, move the sprite, collide with things
- first thing, model the Castaway velocity with a 2D vector

```
func _process(delta):
	var velocity = Vector2(0, 0)
```
- the Godot documentation provides an overview of [vector mathematics](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/math/vector_math.html#doc-vector-math)
  - our game won't rely so heavily on this, as the player can only 'transform' along one dimension at a time
  - do take note of the coordinate system for our implementation [x, y]
- next, translate each input control
  - `if` we see the `move_up` signal, change the velocity in the 'y' dimension
  - else, if (`elif`) we see a different signal, change the velocity in the corresponding dimension
  - conditionals like these are always evaluating a 'boolean' expression
    - evaluates as `true` or `false`

```
func _process(delta):
	var velocity = Vector2(0, 0)
	if Input.is_action_pressed("move_up"):
		velocity.y = velocity.y - 1
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("move_left"):
		velocity.x = velocity.x - 1
	...
```
- the `...` above indicate that your additional code should follow in these notes
  - this will also indicate afformentioned code blocks
- then, start the "walk" animation if we observe a change in velocity
  - otherwise (`else`), play the "idle" animation

```
func _process(delta):
	...
	if velocity.length() > 0:
		$AnimatedSprite.play("walk")
	else:
		$AnimatedSprite.play("idle")
```
- the reference to `$AnimatedSprite` is to the 'AnimatedSprite' child node on the 'Castaway' scene
  - we can do so because the script is associated with the top-level scene - composed with the child node we referenced
  - we could also just as easily reference the `CollisionShape2D` node
  - to learn about `play()` and `stop()`, you can read the 'AnimatedSprite' documentation
- finally, use the velocity to update the Castaway's position for the frame
  - `position` is a property on the Castaway scene node, which we can reference/modify within our script

```
func _process(delta):
	...
	# unit-vector, scale by speed (pixels/sec), scale by factor delta (seconds since last frame was built)
	position = position + (velocity * speed * delta)
	position.x = clamp(position.x, 0, game_window_size.x)
	position.y = clamp(position.y, 0, game_window_size.y)
```
- a unit vector is one with a magnitude of 1, no matter the dimension or direction (angle)
- the `clamp` function is a convenient way to constrain a value between two others
  - in this case, we're clamping the x and y values to stay within the window size

##### Test your progress
- Click the play button at the top right to preview your new behavior
- If you see anything unexpected, double back over your code and confirm that it matches the guide

#### Modifying animations when the Castaway turns around
- our walk animation only indicates that the Castaway is facing right
- we can edit the check against `velocity.length() > 0` to include an additional check on 'x'

```
func _process(delta):
	...
	if velocity.length() > 0:
		# if the x component of the velocity is non-zero
		if velocity.x != 0:
			$AnimatedSprite.flip_h = velocity.x < 0 # the sprite should flip if true - by default, this is false (don't flip)
		$AnimatedSprite.play("walk")
	...
```

##### Press play and test the updated animation

### Next time
- collisions
- obstacles
