### Videogame Development Pt. 6
- Movable obstacles (boxes)
- Creating a puzzle

#### Layers and masks
- Godot provides a collision layer system for managing how objects see one another
  - and how they interpret whether a collision has occurred, and who was collided
- Now that we have multiple types of obstacles, the _Castaway_, and the level boundaries
- We can name and assign layers for these different classes of objects
  - a layer for _Obstacle_, _SlimeObstacle_, _MovableObstacle_, _Castaway_, and the 'TileMap' surrounding the player
- Once the layers are in place, we need to mask each of the scenes for the corresponding collisions
  - _Castaway_ collides with all layers
  - _Obstacle_ and the 'TileMap' collides with the _Castaway_ and _MovableObstacle_
  - _SlimeObstacle_ collides only with the _Castaway_
  - _MovableObstacle_ collides with all layers

### Next time
