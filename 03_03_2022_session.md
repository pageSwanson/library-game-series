## Videogame programming Pt. 5
- Painful obstacles (slime)

### Quality of life improvements
- If you download this project, you'll find that the associated 'art' assets are blurry
  - this is a result of the asset import defaults, where the Godot engine applies a filter
  - this filter isn't something we want for 2D pixelated assets, since this tries to blend adjacent pixels
  - I disabled in 'Project Settings...' under 'Import Defaults'
- Keep the _Castaway_'s back turned
  - when we animate the idle animation, we face the character sprite 'forward'
  - it's a bit more natural to maintain the orientation of the _Castaway_ after we move each time
  - we can edit the `$AnimatedSprite` updates and remove the call to the 'idle' animation

### Painful obstacles (slime)
- Whenever developing something large (game or whatever):
  - take care to review your original spec and keep yourself on track
  - take note of all your deviations so you can be aware of the time you're spending

#### Our idea
- we realize that if we touch anything made of slime, we turn into to slime - terrible
- we have to stick to what is not slime

#### Implementing slime
- We have a suitable scene that we can use for creating slime
  - the _Obstacle_ should work essentially the same way
  - except we want a few different behaviors
    - we want to end the game if the _Castaway_ collides with slime
    - the sprite should appear different, so the player knows that it's dangerous

#### Create a new scene _SlimeObstacle_ that extends _Obstacle_
- Select 'Scene > New Inherited Scene...' from the top ribbon, and choose the _Obstacle_
  - Notice that we get a scene that has the same constituents as the _Obstacle_, but is distinct
  - Changes we make here won't affect the _Obstacle_
- In the 'Inspector' tab on the right-hand side
  - open the 'Collision' property and set the 'Layer' bit to '3'
  - we'll see why soon enough
- Add a child instance of _SlimeObstacle_ to the _Planet\_0_ scene
  - should be a sibling of _Castaway_, the 'TileMap', etc
- Create a script for this scene
  - this is where we'll define behavior that deviates from the typical _Obstacle_

#### Ending the game on player collision
- First, we'll make edits to the _Castaway_ from that perspective of the collision
- Add a `signal`- something we can broadcast when the player collides with slime
  - we can use a generic name considering the result is the same for any collision with slime
  - add to the top of 'Castaway.gd', nearest other member variables
```
signal hit
```
- we can emit the signal within `_physics_process` as we detect a collision
- instead of simply calling `move_and_collide()`, we'll use the returned object from the method
  - if a return object is present (non-null) then we can check for collisions
```
    ...
    move_and_slide(velocity * speed)
    for i in get_slide_count():
	    var collision_layer : int = get_slide_collision(i).collider.get_collision_layer()
	    if collision_layer == 0b100:
		    hide()
            # can't change physics properties within this method, like interrupting other processes
            # so we'll defer the disable of this collision shape until after the physics processes are finished
		    $CollisionShape2D.set_deferred("disabled", true)
		    emit_signal("hit") # perform all actions on hit only after taking care of the above
```
- Though we're hiding the _Castaway_ and disabling collisions for the time being
  - we'll want to restore these properties on the scene when the level is restarted
- Create a new method on _Castaway_
```
func enable_collisions() -> void:
	$CollisionShape2D.set_deferred("disabled", false)
```
- now that's we're emitting the signal, we need to receive it to indicate game end
- In _Planet\_0_, we can add code to check for the emitted signal, and to reset the level
  - this way, the game will 'restart' when the player is hit, so they can try again
- Open 'Planet\_0.gd' and select the 'Node' tab on the right-hand side
  - double-click the 'hit' signal (which comes from 'Castaway.gd')
  - Connect it to the top-level _Planet\_0_
```
func _on_Castaway_hit():
    initialize()
```
- this function can call `initialize` as we do in `_ready`
- finally, add the following lines to the `initialize` function
```
func initialize() -> void:
	$Castaway.set_position($StartPosition.position)
	$Castaway.show()
	$Castaway.enable_collisions()
```
- Try playing the scene now

#### Adding variation to the slime appearance
- So that the slime has some variety, we can randomly load an asset when the scene is built
- First, select all of the assets you intend to use for representing slime
  - move them into a subfolder of the 'art' directory
- In the `_ready` function, add the following
```
func _ready():
	$Sprite.texture = load("res://art/slime/tile_0127.png")
```
- we can get some variety by randomly flipping the image across the y-axis
  - we'll simulate a coin toss with a random number to determine whether to flip
```
func _ready():
	$Sprite.texture = load("res://art/slime/tile_0127.png")
    # use a coin-toss probability distribution to decide whether to flip the texture
    $Sprite.flip_h = randf() > 0.5 # generate a floating point number between 0 and 1, test if above 0.5
```
- NOTE: you'll likely notice that when playing the scene, the sprite will not flip differently each time
    - this is due to a random seed
    - the seed can be changed each time with a call to [`randomize()`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/math/random_number_generation.html?highlight=randomize#the-randomize-method) on `_ready`

##### Selecting a random texture
- We'll use a different random distribution to select a texture
  - from the pool of available slime textures in the subdirectory we created
- Begin by creating a new method in 'SlimeObstacle.gd' where we open the slime subdirectory
```
func load_slime_texture() -> String:
	var slime_directory : Directory = Directory.new()
	if slime_directory.open("res://art/slime") != OK:
		print("An error occurred when trying to access the path.")
		return ""
```
- Open the directory stream so we can look through the files
- Setup a variable to keep the current file name as we look through, and an [`Array`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_array.html?#class-array) to store each one
```
    ...
    slime_directory.list_dir_begin(true, true)
	var file_name : String = slime_directory.get_next()
	var slime_file_names : Array = []
    ...
```
- Move through the files in the directory and add them to a list
  - ensure we only capture the asset files in particular
  - you could name them uniquely, or check the file extension (ending)
- Pay attention to the indentation!
```
    ...
    while file_name != "":
		if file_name.ends_with(".png"):
			slime_file_names.append(file_name)
		file_name = slime_directory.get_next()
	slime_directory.list_dir_end()
    ...
```
- At the end of the method, return a random entry in the collection of file names
```
    ...
    # generate a random integer and confine it between 0 and the size of the collection of names
    # return the file name string
    return slime_file_names[randi() % slime_file_names.size()]
```
- Finally, update the load call in the `_ready` function
```
func _ready():
    # optionally uncomment the line below to change the random seed
	# randomize()
	$Sprite.texture = load("res://art/slime/" + load_slime_texture())
	$Sprite.flip_h = randf() > 0.5
```
- Test your changes
