## Videogame programming Pt. 4
- Creating obstacles
- Creating a level
- Player character collisions

### Asset updates
- The updated project has some simplified assets
- Great resource for open-source assets
  - The particular pack I'm using is the 'Micro Roguelike'
  - https://kenney.nl/assets/micro-roguelike
- I also scaled the project down to match these assets
  - I changed the project to be a 400 x 400 pixel window

### Adding obstacles
- we realize that if we touch anything made of slime, we turn into to slime - terrible
- we have to stick to what is not slime
- but we also have to escape a maze
  - by moving blocks that are not slime

#### Create a new _Obstacle_ scene
- From the top ribbon, 'Scene > New Scene'
- Choose 'Other Node' for the root node, and search for 'KinematicBody2D'
  - [This](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/physics_introduction.html#doc-physics-introduction) article within the Godot documentation gives an overview of the different physics bodies
  - Choosing this node means we will be providing the physics responses using our own code, but the node will let us know if there's been a collision
- Add the following nodes to the scene:
  - a 'Sprite' will represent the obstacle on screen
  - a 'CollisionShape2D' describes the bounds of the obstacle
- Make sure the object's children aren't selectable
  - icon with two small squares on the scene ribbon, next to the lock
- Save your new scene

#### Adding a texture to the 'Sprite'
- Add your selected asset / art to the 'art' subdirectory in the project
  - I'm using the assets mentioned at the top
- With the 'Sprite' node selected:
  - Choose a sprite from the FileSystem view on the left-hand side (from the 'art' folder)
  - Drag it over to the right-hand Inspector property 'Texture'
- Scale the sprite up or down, considering the size of your character sprite and the playfield
  - In the inspector, go to 'Transform > Scale' - I scaled by 3 for x and y

#### Shaping the _Obstacle_ collision boundary
- Select the 'Shape' property on the 'CollisionShape2D' node
- Choose a shape that best fits your sprite
- Align the edges using the mouse to match the border
  - I suggest setting the boundary _within_ the sprite
  - You can do this manually (entering dimensions) by clicking the selected shape in the dropdown again
  - You'll be prompted to enter x + y dimensions

### Unifying the scenes
- We have a distinct scene for our obstacle (_Obstacle_), and a one for the player character (_Castaway_)
- A new scene will let us combine the two and create a level
  - Using the object-oriented features of Godot, we can compose a scene made up of others

#### Create a new scene of class 'Node' (not 'Node2D')
- Give a meaningful name to represent the level, like _Planet\_0_
- Link the _Castaway_ with the chain link button (next to the plus)
  - you should see the _Castaway_ sprite appear in the viewport
- Add a 'Position2D' node to the scene - we'll use it to set the position of the _Castaway_ for the level
  - ensure that you haven't added it as a child of the _Castaway_
  - call this something informative, like 'StartPosition'
  - in the inspector for this new node, set the 'Transform > Position' property somewhere at an edge of the viewport
    - I used x = 25, y = 375 
- Save this new scene
  - You should have 3 at this point: _Castaway_, _Obstacle_, and this new _Planet\_0_ scene

#### Add _Obstacle_ instances to the scene
- Select the _Planet\_0_ root node and use the same chain link button to link a scene
- Choose the _Obstacle_
- Once the instance has been added, you should see the _Obstacle_ sprite appear in the viewport

#### Testing the _Planet\_0_
- Open up the _Castaway_ script (Castaway.gd) and add a new function
  - you can add this anywhere - mine is above the `_ready` function
```
func set_position(input_position : Vector2) -> void:
	position = input_position
```
- Select _Planet\_0_ and add a new script
- Include the following to initialize the _Castaway_ position
```
func initialize() -> void:
	$Castaway.set_position($StartPosition.position)
```
- This sets the _Castaway_ position to the position we assigned 'StartPosition' when the level begins
- Call this new function within the `_ready` scope in 'Planet_0.gd'
```
func _ready():
	initialize()
```
- Play the _Planet\_0_ scene using the clapper icon at the top right
- you should see the _Castaway_ take the position we set
- The _Obstacle_ sprite also appears in the view
  - you can move the _Obstacle_ by dragging in the editor - you can then observe the change when playing again

### Colliding with the _Obstacle_
- You probably noticed when play testing that collisions do not happen for now
  - the _Castaway_ simply passes through the _Obstacle_
- This is because the basis of our _Castaway_ node is just a 2D area
  - we can change the position, respond to inputs, and render a sprite
  - we can also check for collisions with other areas and bodies..
  - .. but the engine will not assume any physics interactions for us

#### Update the _Castaway_ to be of the 'KinematicBody2D' type
- Select the _Castaway_ within the editor
  - Note: don't select the scene within _Planet\_0_, as this is only an instance of the _Castaway_
  - we want to change the scene generally, not just for this level
- Right-click the node and select "Change Type"
  - Search the type 'KinematicBody2D' and select it
- Save the updated scene

#### Updating the _Castaway_ script
- Since we're changing the basis of the scene, we need to change the script
- First, update the `extends` line at the top, changing 'Area2D' to 'KinematicBody2D'
- Since we want our _Castaway_ to interact with the physics engine (colliding with _Obstacles_), we don't want to change the position directly
  - instead, we want to respond to control inputs by applying forces to the 'KinematicBody2D'
  - The 'CollisionShape2D' node on the scene will properly dictate when we collide with other bodies
- We can re-use a lot of the code we created for updating position
  - but now, we'll use the velocity to update a 'force' that the engine will apply to the body

#### Coding applied forces using `_physics_process`
- Add a new function to the 'Castaway.gd' script
  - this function is another hook which is available to us via the 'KinematicBody2D' type
```
# unlike process, this lets us handle physics updates in tandem with the frame rate
# the input is delta, which is the time since the last frame (based on the current framerate)
# the input is of type float (a floating point number, like 0.33)
# the output is void i.e. nothing! This function doesen't return anything
func _physics_process(delta : float) -> void:
	var velocity : Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)
```
- Just as with the `_process` function before, we'll use a `Vector2` to represent the velocity
- From here, we can use the same logic for updating the velocity as before
```
func _physics_process(delta : float) -> void:
	var velocity : Vector2 = Vector2(0, 0)
	if Input.is_action_pressed("move_down"):
		velocity.y = velocity.y + 1
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("move_left"):
		velocity.x = velocity.x - 1
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("move_up"):
		velocity.y = velocity.x - 1
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("move_right"):
		velocity.x = velocity.x + 1

	if velocity.length() > 0:
		if velocity.y > 0:
			$AnimatedSprite.play("down")
		elif velocity.y < 0:
			$AnimatedSprite.play("up")
		# if the x component of the velocity is non-zero
		elif velocity.x != 0:
			$AnimatedSprite.play("right")
			$AnimatedSprite.flip_h = velocity.x < 0
	else:
		$AnimatedSprite.play("idle")
```
- Now we need to indicate that the engine should apply a force on our body with the vector we've created
```
func _physics_process(delta : float) -> void:
    ...
    # scale velocity by the speed (pixels / second)
    move_and_slide(velocity * speed)
```
- Note that we don't need `delta` for our motion here - since we aren't ever updating faster than the framerate
  - Updates here will always happen at the same rate and our changes in velocity should be consistent
  - i.e. we don't have to worry about updating the position faster than the view is changing
- With these changes, simply remove the `_process` function altogether

### Testing _Planet\_0_
- Playing the scene again, you should observe that we collide with the _Obstacle_
- Note that the _Castaway_ no longer 'collides' with the bounds of the view
  - previously we were simply preventing updates to position that put us out of frame
  - now, since we're interacting with the physics engine - we ought to add a wall to collide with

#### Adding a wall around the player
- Create new child 'TileMap' Node on the _Planet\_0_
- Begin by changing the 'Cell > Size' property in the inspector to match your tile sizes
  - My assets are 8 x 8 pixels, so I'm using that sizing for my cells
- In the Inspector on the right, select the 'Tile Set' property and choose 'New TileSet'
  - click the dropdown again once selected to open the editor
- At the bottom left, select the 'Plus' icon to bring in your assets as tiles
- Once you've selected all the tiles to include, they'll appear on the left-hand side
- For each, use 'New Single Tile' at the top right to select the tile as a cell using the auto-snap feature
  - You might need to work with this - I had to update the 'Step' on the right-hand side when selecting a cell
  - You can adjust this step size until you see the grid match the size of your tile
- Once you've fit the tile and selected it, you'll need to select the tile type
  - if you want a collision with the player, select 'Collision', choose the shape, and select the cell
  - if you want something like a floor or background without collision, choose 'Region' and select the cell

#### Test your changes by playing the main scene again

### Next time
- Painful obstacles (slime)
- Movable obstacles
- Creating a puzzle
