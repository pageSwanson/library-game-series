## Videogame Development Pt. 7
- Reaching an objective
- Creating a puzzle
- Displaying game information

### Review our objective
- we have to stick to what is not slime
- but we also have to escape a maze
  - by moving blocks that are not slime

### Reaching the end of the maze
- we need to make an end-game position
- this can be placeable within the level
  - ideally, poses a challenge for the player to reach
- reaching this point should end the level

#### Implementing the maze objective
- Create a new scene with a root node 'Area2D'
  - our idea is to create a space that the player enters
  - when the space is entered, it triggers an event (level completion)
  - rename the root _Objective_
- Add a 'Sprite' node
  - load a texture from the 'art' directory
  - compare against the 'Sprite' child of other scenes
- Add a child node 'CollisionShape2D'
  - this will define the colllision boundary for the objective
  - ensure that the boundary / shape matches your sprite texture
- Set the layer + mask on the _Objective_
  - in the Inspector tab on the root node
  - set Layer 5 (new layer)
  - mask layer _Castaway_
- Set the Z-index to '-1' on _Objective_
  - so that the _Castaway_ appears above the _Objective_ sprite
  - in the Inspector on the right-hand side
  - under 'Node2D', change the 'Z Index' property
- Save the new scene
- Add a child instance of this scene in the level, _Planet\_0_

#### Scripting the maze objective
- Determine when the _Castaway_ collides with the _Objective_ boundary
- Emit a signal
- Respond to the signal in the _Planet\_0_ script
  - end the game

##### Emitting the signal
- Create a new script for the _Objective_
- Open the script and add a new signal
  - called 'reached'
- Select the root node from the Scene tree, and open the 'Node' tab
  - on the right-hand side
- From the list of available Signals (you should see also the one you've added)
  - select 'body_entered' and double-click
  - select 'Connect' at the bottom with the default options
- This adds a new function to our script, which we'll modify

```
func _on_Objective_body_entered(body):
	emit_signal("reached")
	$CollisionShape2D.set_deferred("disabled", true) # don't interrupt physics
```

##### Receiving the signal
- All we need to do now is respond to the signal
  - we'll do this as we did for the 'hit' signal
  - which means updating the _Castaway_ script
- Select the _Planet\_0_ scene node
  - find the _Objective_ in the scene tree (child instance of the root node)
  - find the signal icon next to the scene label
- From the 'Node' tab on the right-hand side, select the 'reached' signal
  - under the 'Objective.gd' section (our _Objective_ script)
  - double-click it and 'Connect' to _Planet\_0_
- Another function was added to the _Planet\_0_ script
  - where we'll implement the end of game behavior
```
func _on_Objective_reached():
	$Castaway.disable()
	# wait some time to display the 'complete' message
	# display the 'complete' message
```
- Calling a function `disable` which doesn't yet exist on the _Castaway_
  - we can create it on the scene script 'Castaway.gd'
```
func disable() -> void:
	hide()
	$CollisionShape2D.set_deferred("disabled", true)
```

### Creating a puzzle
- We're nearing a playable game
  - With the components we have, we can start arranging a level
- Try different arrangements of slime, moveable obstacles, obstacles, and player positions
- Try changing the shape of the 'TileMap'
- Some mechanical ideas
  - Remember creating the 'Position2D' nodes for resetting after slime is touched?
  - These could be moved or reset when the player makes certain moves
    - could _not_ reset moveable obstacle positions
    - could change player starting position after moving certain boxes

### Displaying information to the player
- the player can now complete the game
- we can now add some kind of indication that the game is over
  - and an indication when the game has started
  - separate from the typical reset on death

#### Implementing the splash screen (title + game end)
- Create a new scene of node type 'CanvasLayer', rename it as 'Splash'
  - This will serve as the basis for the title scene and the game end
- To build up the screen, 'Label' nodes will be used for text display

##### Displaying splash text
- Add a 'Label' node as a child of the Splash
- In the Inspector for this node, add to the 'Text' property
  - start with the title screen, so add a name for the game
- From the 2D viewport ribbon, you can select 'Use Grid Snap' to align the 'Label'
- You can change the scale of the 'Label' in the Inspector
  - note that the default font does not scale so well
    - you can load a '.ttf' file (a font file)
    - go to 'Theme Overrides > Fonts' and load your file
- For the label node, ensure that the Text property 'Align' is set to 'Center'
  - this way, changes to the text will center appropriately
- Add a 'ColorRect' node, for a splash background
  - move the node before the 'Label' node, so it appears behind the text
  - adjust the color to contrast the text
  - adjust the size to fill the background
  - select the 'Layout' control from the viewport ribbon, click 'Full Rect'

##### Timing the splash display
- Add a 'Timer' node
  - used to limit the display time of the splash
  - In the Inspector, enable 'One Shot' and set 'Wait Time' to '2'
- We'll use the same screen for game end
  - but we'll need to script the text change for that purpose
- Save the new scene

#### Showing the splash at game start
- Create a script for the 'Splash'
- Add a signal
```
signal start_game
```
- Add a method to show the splash and begin a countdown
```
func display_and_countdown() -> void:
	# reference the nodes as you named them
	$ColorRect.show()
	$Message.show()
	$Timer.start()
```
- Connect the signal from the 'Timer' indicating that it's done
  - we'll use this to hide the splash
  - from the Scene tree on the left, find the 'Timer'
  - click the signal symbol
  - from the Node tab on the right, double-click `timeout()`
  - connect it to the parent 'Splash' node
    - this should add a function to the script
```
func _on_Timer_timeout() -> void:
	$ColorRect.hide()
	$Message.hide()
```
- Add methods for beginning, restarting, and ending the game with a splash
```
func start_game() -> void:
	$Message.text = "Space Castaway"
	display_and_countdown()
	yield($Timer, "timeout")
	emit_signal("game_start")

func retry_game() -> void:
	$Message.text = "Game Over"
	display_and_countdown()
	# add this yield so we hesitate before restarting the level
	yield($Timer, "timeout")
	start_game()

func end_game() -> void:
	$Message.text = "You Escaped"
	$ColorRect.show()
	$Message.show()
```

##### 'Splashing'
- With the functions we've developed, we can connect this scene to the level
  - begin by creating a child instance of _Splash_ on the _Planet\_0_
- Open the _Planet\_0_ script for editing
- To start the game, update the `_ready` function to use our new methods
```
# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	$Splash.start_game()
```
- Connect the 'game_start' signal 
  - from the _Planet\_0_ scene tree, select the _Splash_
  - in the node tab on the right, double click the `game_start()` signal
  - connect it to the _Planet\_0_ root node and observe the `_on_Splash_game_start()`
  - update the new function and other signal responses as follows
```
func _on_Castaway_hit():
	# the player hit slime - allow them to retry
	$Splash.retry_game()

func _on_Objective_reached():
	$Castaway.disable()
	# use a quick timer and
	# wait before splash and close the game
	yield(get_tree().create_timer(2), "timeout")
	# the game is completed
	$Splash.end_game()

func _on_Splash_game_start():
    # the start game splash ended - initialize the play field
	initialize()
```
- Save and test the changes
- The game is completed!

### What other additions can you imagine?
- lives count
- multiple objectives
- load another level on completion
- timer for completing the level
- sound effects

### Next time
- bring in your level designs, new mechanics, game functions, other creations
